# Note Taker App

[alt text](/Assets/images/NoteTakerAppScreenshot.jpg)

## Description

This application allows the user to take notes and review past notes contained in a JSON file, mimicking the use of a database. The application uses a server and get/put routes to fetch and make changes to previous note files.

- This project involved practicing the interaction of front-end code with back-end server code. 
- This application is a desktop/mobile app that allows the user to make open-ended notes and store them in an organized manner by title.
- I learned concepts relating to the interaction of front-end code with back-end server code relevant to full-stack web development. 

## Usage

This is a simple note-taking app where the user can review previous notes stored in a JSON file, and compose new notes with a title and text area.

## Credits

The front-end code was provided by UNC Coding Bootcamp. This project was worked in groups during UNC Coding Bootcamp classes and may have similarities to other classmate's coding patterns due to collaborative efforts.
